            <h1 className=""><span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-xl">Attire: </span> Beach weddings call for lightweight, breathable attire. For the bride, consider a flowing, ethereal wedding dress, perhaps with a shorter hemline or a beachy, boho design. Grooms can opt for linen or seersucker suits in light colors for a laid-back yet polished look.
            </h1>
            <h1 className=""><span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-xl">Ceremony: </span> Plan a simple yet heartfelt beachfront ceremony. Consider a bamboo arch adorned with flowers for your altar. Incorporate the soothing sound of waves into your vows for a unique touch. Beach weddings often feature a sand unity ceremony, where the couple combines colored sands into one vessel, symbolizing their union.
            </h1>
            <h1 className=""><span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-xl">Reception: </span> Beach receptions are all about embracing the natural surroundings. Set up dining tables on the sand with beachy tableware and twinkling fairy lights overhead. Opt for fresh seafood and tropical cocktails to please your guests palates. A bonfire or lantern-lit dance floor can create a magical atmosphere as the night unfolds.
            </h1>
            <h1 className=""><span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-xl">Entertainment: </span> Live bands or acoustic musicians playing tropical tunes can set the mood during cocktail hour and the reception. Consider organizing beach games like beach volleyball, frisbee, or even a bonfire sing-along to keep guests entertained.
            </h1>
            <h1 className=""><span className="text-red-600 font-bold text-xl">Conclusion: </span> A beach wedding is a dreamy, romantic, and unforgettable experience that combines natural beauty with the celebration of love. By carefully planning your location, decor, attire, ceremony, reception, and entertainment, you can create the beach wedding of your dreams, leaving you and your guests with cherished memories that will last a lifetime. So, say I do with the sun, sand, and love as your witnesses!
